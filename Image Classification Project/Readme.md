# Image classification
In this project we have two classes of Leukemia or Normal cell images, Which has done this task using convolutional networks and keras libraries Methods used in this project:
* data augmentation including (histogram equalization, rotation, shearing and etc.) 
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 10 layers
* Dropout
* Softmax
