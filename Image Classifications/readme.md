# Image classification

Image classification is the process of categorizing and labeling groups of pixels or vectors within an image based on specific rules.
The categorization law can be devised using one or more spectral or textural characteristics. Two general methods of classification are 'supervised' and 'unsupervised'.
Image classification refers to the task of extracting information classes from a multiband raster image. The resulting raster from image classification can be used to create thematic maps.
Image classification is where a computer can analyse an image and identify the 'class' the image falls under. (Or a probability of the image being part of a 'class'.) A class is essentially a label, for instance, 'car', 'animal', 'building' and so on.
